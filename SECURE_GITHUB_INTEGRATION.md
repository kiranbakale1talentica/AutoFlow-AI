# 🔐 Secure GitHub Integration - No More Personal Access Tokens!

## ✅ **What's Changed**

The AutoFlow AI dashboard now uses **secure GitHub OAuth authentication** instead of requiring you to manually enter personal access tokens. This is much safer and more user-friendly!

## 🚀 **How It Works Now**

### 1. **Connect to GitHub (One-Time Setup)**
- Click "Add Specific Pipelines" in the dashboard
- Click "Connect with GitHub" 
- You'll be redirected to GitHub's secure login page
- Grant permissions to AutoFlow AI (read repository info and workflows)
- You'll be redirected back to the dashboard, fully authenticated!

### 2. **Select Your Pipelines**
- Browse your repositories (private and public)
- See recommended repositories with CI/CD workflows
- Select specific workflows you want to monitor
- Create pipelines with one click!

### 3. **Automatic Sync**
- Your pipelines will automatically sync with GitHub
- No need to manage tokens or credentials
- Secure session-based authentication

## 🛡️ **Security Benefits**

✅ **No Token Management**: No need to create, store, or manage personal access tokens  
✅ **Minimal Permissions**: Only requests access to repository information and workflows  
✅ **Secure OAuth Flow**: Uses GitHub's official OAuth 2.0 authentication  
✅ **Session-Based**: Tokens are securely managed by the application  
✅ **Revocable Access**: You can revoke access anytime from GitHub settings
